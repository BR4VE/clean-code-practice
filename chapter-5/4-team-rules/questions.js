// Question 1:
// How we should teach/warn our teammates
// if they break the unwritten rules of clean code?

// Some of the stuff (like indentation) can be agreed on dicussing with the whole
// team and applied to linters?

// However there are other conceptual rules (like giving understandable proper names)
// to variables. What should be our strategy about that? Should we write documentation?
